### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<button onclick="regis()">Register</button>
<script>
  function regis(){
    setTimeout(function() {
      alert("Sorry, the registration service is currently unavailable.")
    },400);
  }
</script>
 /* when button is clicked alert will show after 400ms  */
```

### Continued development

 in the future i will learn more about javascript.
